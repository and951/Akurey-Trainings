This part of the training is an extension of the first javascript training task. The intention of this addition is to integrate all of the other training concepts:

- Clean Code
- SASS/Compass
- Javascript/jQuery
- Grunt for concatenation and minification.


## Javascript

As this exercise is in the javascript module it makes some emphasis in the following concepts:
